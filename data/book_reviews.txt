I loved Tolkien’s fantasy classic 'The Hobbit', first published in 1937. Such a charming adventure!
George Orwell’s '1984' is a chilling dystopian masterpiece from 1949 that feels frighteningly relevant today.
Jane Austen’s 'Pride and Prejudice' is a timeless romantic classic that brilliantly critiques social norms.
